     <p>The biggest challenge with assignment 1 was getting familiar with HTML. I had never used this language prior to this course, so I had to use some outside resources to get familiar with the language and its quirks. Once I got used to using things such as p and strong and other common HTML functions, I didn't find writing the rest of the code to be too difficult. Everything seemed to come pretty naturally after that. The only other thing I had trouble with was figuring out how to get my code posted online to a website. It took me a minute to get GitHub pages figured out, but thankfully I was able to get both my pages posted onto the internet. All in all, I think that this assignment was a very good introduction to the course. It introduced me to the basic concepts we will be exploring this term and started to get me comfortable with HTML.</strong></p></p>
